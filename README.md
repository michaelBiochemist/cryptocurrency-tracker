# Cryptocurrency Tracker #

This is designed to track cryptocurrency prices of the user's choosing. 
The user will then be able to set alerts when the prices go outside of deviated ranges. (Funcionality to be added)

The user can also upload historical data (as found on https://coincodex.com/) to enable reporting and more sophisticated rules for the alerts. 

To run:
    - mkdir "data/" in core project directory (apologies that's a part of my gitignore file right now)
    - go to coinmarketcap.com and get an api key. Update the api_keys_sample.json file with the correct api key and rename the file as "api_keys.json"

(Todo moved to youtrack instance. Will update readme after PyPi packaging)
